Hello and welcome to my Cyber Museum website! This is a Bootstrap project made for a fictional tech museum, with the guidance of Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp! 

The IMG folder holds all of the website images, some unused. 

Only the homepage, using index.html, is made so far; I will likely revisit to create other pages such as an About section!

The style.css stylesheet holds my personal extra styling that Bootstrap doesn't provide. 

Thank you for visiting!
